                <h2> Missile Man of India</h2>
                <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam
                    15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July 2015
                    was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as
                    the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and
                    raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and
                    aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a
                    scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence
                    Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space
                    Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in
                    India's civilian space programme and military missile
                    development efforts. He thus came to be known as the
                    Missile Man of India for his work on the development of
                    ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.
                    He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and
                    political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998,
                    the first since the original nuclear test by
                    India in 1974.</p>
